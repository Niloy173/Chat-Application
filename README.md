# Feature

- Authentication system enabled
- Real-Time chat system configured
- Search engine optimised for user search
- Role Based user creation

# WorkFlow

This project is based on the real time chat system between one and another user.After user login (While checking all the field in authentication) an user can find his/her friend with a user search engine (developed quite efficiently and very much optimized) to add and starting chating & also the person has the right to delete the messages but don't have permission to create users by their own as admin will handle the user creation.

In the future task, I will try to develop a system (Friend List) for each user which he/she added
through out the search engine will show up in his/her friend zone.

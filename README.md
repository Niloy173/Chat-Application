# WorkFlow

This project is based on the real time chat system between one and another user.After user login (While checking all the field in authentication) an user can find his/her friend with a user search engine (developed quite efficiently and very much optimized) to add and starting chating & also the person has the right to delete the messages but don't have permission to ***create users*** by their own as ***admin will handle the user creation***.so check the [file](https://github.com/Niloy173/Chat-Application/blob/master/admin.txt) in the root folder for login as admin Well, you might have the admin prevlige to create, update or delete access but as I have said, this is a fun project you can assume to make a room for yourself with your freinds and start chating. Have fun!!!!!!

In the future task, I will try to develop a system (Friend List) for each user which he/she added
through out the search engine will show up in his/her friend zone.
